                <h2>My website is pretty cool.</h2>
                <p>I made this website so I think it's pretty cool. Ego? What ego? I like to dance and play League of
                    Legends and other stuff. I also take pictures sometimes.</p>
                <p>In league of legends, my favorite champions are Malphite and Mao'kai, I like tanky champs in general.
                    I like to breakdance, it's actually called "B-Boying" though. I use Adobe Photoshop and and Adobe
                    Lightroom for my photography hobby.</p>
                <p>I like to talk to my friends on Discord while we play games like League of legends or Valorant. I
                    really like MMORPGs like Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft, etc.</p>
